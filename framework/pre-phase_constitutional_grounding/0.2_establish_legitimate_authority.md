# 0.2 — Establish Legitimate Authority to Govern the Defined Object

This section establishes **who is permitted to govern the defined object**, on what grounds that authority is legitimate, and what that authority entitles them to constrain.

Governance without legitimate authority is coercion, aspiration, or theatre.
This section exists to prevent all three.

No subsequent governance activity is valid unless authority has been explicitly established.

---

## 0.2.1 Why this exists

### Purpose

The purpose of this section is to require that **governance authority is explicitly grounded before it is exercised**.

AI systems exert real-world influence. That influence produces behaviour and impact.
Constraining that behaviour, or mitigating that impact, requires authority that is:

* legitimate
* recognised
* enforceable

Absent explicit authority:

* constraints will be ignored under pressure
* responsibility will be deflected or laundered
* enforcement will occur only after harm
* governance will be retroactively justified rather than prospectively applied

This section exists to ensure that governance is **authorised before it is needed**, not rationalised after failure.

## 0.2.2 Definition — Legitimate Authority

### Meaning

For the purposes of this framework, **legitimate authority** is defined as:

> **The recognised right to impose constraints on system behaviour and to require mitigation of system impact.**

Authority is not inferred from intent, expertise, or moral preference.
It must be grounded in a recognised source that grants the right to constrain behaviour.

This is a **binding definition**, not a symbolic one.

---

### Sources of legitimacy

Legitimate authority may arise from one or more of the following sources:

* Legal mandate (statutory, regulatory, judicial)
* Organisational mandate (board authority, executive delegation)
* Contractual authority (binding agreements, procurement terms)
* Fiduciary duty (duty of care, duty to prevent foreseeable harm)
* Delegated authority (explicit transfer of governance power)
* Collective mandate (formally constituted multi-party governance)

Informal influence, technical expertise, or ethical concern **do not constitute authority** unless formally recognised through one of the above mechanisms.

---

## 0.2.3 What authority governs

### Behavioural constraint

Legitimate authority governs the right to:

* constrain system behaviour
* prohibit specific classes of output or action
* require safeguards, controls, or overrides
* mandate human intervention or termination

Authority attaches to **behaviour**, not internal implementation.

If behaviour can be constrained, authority applies — regardless of how that behaviour is produced.

---

### Impact mitigation

Legitimate authority also governs the right to:

* require mitigation of known or foreseeable harms
* mandate monitoring and reporting of impacts
* impose corrective action or remediation
* suspend or revoke system operation

Impact-based authority applies **even when behaviour is indirect, probabilistic, or mediated by humans**.

If system influence contributes materially to impact, authority applies.

---

## 0.2.4 Authority scope and limits

### Scope

Authority applies to the full object of governance as defined in **0.1**, within the radius of behavioural influence and impact.

Authority:

* is not limited to models or components
* is not negated by human-in-the-loop structures
* is not avoided through abstraction or outsourcing

Where behaviour or impact exists, authority may be exercised.

---

### Limits

Authority is limited to what is necessary to:

* constrain harmful behaviour
* prevent unacceptable outcomes
* mitigate material impact

Authority does not extend to:

* unconstrained optimisation of values
* arbitrary control absent impact risk
* retroactive justification of unowned decisions

Legitimate authority must be **proportionate to risk and impact**.

---

## 0.2.5 Conflicting or overlapping authority

### Meaning

Where multiple authorities claim the right to govern the same system:

* authority must be made explicit
* precedence must be defined
* conflict resolution mechanisms must exist

Undefined or implicit authority conflicts constitute a governance failure.

Where authority is contested, governance **must default to the most restrictive constraint compatible with safety** until resolution occurs.

---

## 0.2.6 Constraint

> **No actor may impose governance constraints without demonstrable legitimate authority to constrain behaviour or mitigate impact.**

Conversely:

> **Where legitimate authority exists, failure to exercise it in the presence of foreseeable harm constitutes a governance failure.**

This constraint is **structural**, **enforceable**, and **non-optional**.
