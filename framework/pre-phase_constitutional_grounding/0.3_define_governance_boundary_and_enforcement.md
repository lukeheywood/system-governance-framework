# 0.3 — Define Governance Boundary and Enforcement Reach

This section establishes **where legitimate authority applies**, how far governance boundaries extend, and **how enforcement may be exercised** across the defined object of governance.

Authority without boundary is symbolic.
Boundary without enforcement is aspirational.

This section exists to make governance **operationally real** before any problem recognition, design, or implementation activity occurs.

No subsequent phase may assume enforceability unless the boundaries and enforcement reach defined here are explicit.

---

## 0.3.1 Why this exists

### Purpose

The purpose of this section is to require that **the reach of governance authority is explicitly defined before it is relied upon**.

AI systems routinely span:

* organisational units
* vendors and contractors
* human and automated decision layers
* jurisdictions and regulatory regimes
* upstream and downstream systems

Without explicit boundary definition:

* authority silently collapses at interfaces
* responsibility is deflected across organisational seams
* enforcement becomes selective or post-hoc
* governance fails precisely where impact occurs

This section exists to prevent governance from stopping at the point of inconvenience.

## 0.3.2 Definition — Governance Boundary

### Meaning

For the purposes of this framework, the **governance boundary** is defined as:

> **The full extent to which legitimate authority may be exercised to constrain behaviour and mitigate impact across the governed system.**

The governance boundary is not limited by:

* organisational charts
* ownership structures
* vendor relationships
* implementation detail
* human vs automated distinctions

Boundary is determined by **influence and impact**, not by control or convenience.

This is a **binding definition**, not an illustrative one.

## 0.3.3 Boundary propagation

### Transitive reach

Governance boundary propagates transitively through the system.

If:

* a component influences behaviour, or
* a system relies on AI-mediated outputs, or
* an actor executes decisions shaped by AI influence

then that component, system, or actor is **within the governance boundary to the extent of that influence**.

Boundary propagation applies:

* upstream (data sources, signals, training inputs)
* laterally (interfaces, orchestration layers, contractors)
* downstream (execution systems, human decision-makers, affected populations)

---

### Human mediation does not terminate boundary

The presence of a human decision-maker does not terminate governance boundary.

If AI influence:

* shapes options
* prioritises attention
* frames decisions
* constrains available actions

then governance boundary remains intact.

Human involvement adds governed actors; it does not remove AI influence from scope.

---

## 0.3.4 Enforcement reach

### Meaning

**Enforcement reach** defines how governance authority may be exercised within the boundary.

Enforcement may include the right to:

* mandate controls or safeguards
* require monitoring, logging, and reporting
* impose operational constraints or thresholds
* suspend, restrict, or terminate system operation
* require remediation or corrective action

Enforcement applies **prospectively**, not only after harm has occurred.

---

### Interface enforcement

Enforcement must be possible at system interfaces.

Where direct control is not available:

* contractual obligations
* procurement conditions
* access controls
* escalation and override mechanisms

must be used to extend enforcement reach.

Lack of direct control does not negate enforcement responsibility.

---

## 0.3.5 Boundary limits and exclusions

### Demonstrable limits

Governance boundary may be limited **only where lack of influence can be demonstrated**.

Assertions of non-influence are insufficient.

Where influence exists:

* partial exclusion is invalid
* selective enforcement is a governance failure

Boundary limitation must be explicit, justified, and reviewable.

---

### Jurisdictional conflict

Where governance boundaries intersect with:

* multiple legal jurisdictions
* conflicting regulatory regimes
* overlapping organisational authority

boundary handling and enforcement precedence **must be explicitly defined**.

Absent resolution, governance must default to:

> **the most restrictive constraint compatible with safety and harm prevention.**

---

## 0.3.6 Constraint

> **Governance authority must extend wherever AI influence produces or contributes to material impact.**

Conversely:

> **Failure to enforce within the defined boundary constitutes a governance failure, regardless of technical complexity or organisational separation.**

This constraint is **structural**, **enforceable**, and **non-optional**.
