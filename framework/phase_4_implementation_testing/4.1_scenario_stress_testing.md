# 4.1 Scenario Stress Testing

This section defines **scenario-based stress testing** as the primary method for validating that AI-enabled systems remain governable under realistic pressure.

Scenario stress testing exists to deliberately surface failure modes **before** systems are trusted in live operation.

Testing here is adversarial by design.

---

## 4.1.1 Purpose

Scenario stress testing exists to:

* Validate that constitutional and architectural constraints hold under pressure
* Expose governance failures before real-world harm occurs
* Test human roles, authority, and interfaces — not just models

Passing normal operation tests is insufficient. Systems must survive stress.

---

## 4.1.2 What Is a Scenario

A scenario is a **plausible, high-impact situation** that challenges one or more of the following:

* Authority clarity
* Human control guarantees
* Control and oversight interfaces
* Enforcement posture under uncertainty

Scenarios are not edge cases. They reflect conditions that can reasonably occur.

---

## 4.1.3 Scenario Design Principles

All scenarios must:

* Be grounded in real operational contexts
* Combine technical, human, and organisational stressors
* Target known unacceptable signals or states
* Be executed without advance notice where feasible

Scenarios that are predictable or sanitised provide false assurance.

## 4.1.4 Required Scenario Categories

At minimum, scenario stress testing must include the following categories.

### Authority Stress

Scenarios that test:

* Conflicting instructions from different authorities
* Absence or unavailability of decision owners
* Escalation under ambiguous ownership

**Expected outcome:** authority resolves decisively or the system pauses.

---

### Control Interface Failure

Scenarios that test:

* Partial or total loss of oversight dashboards
* Degraded control responsiveness
* Interface usability under time pressure

**Expected outcome:** control remains actionable or the system fails safe.

---

### Unacceptable Signal Escalation

Scenarios that test:

* Multiple unacceptable signals appearing simultaneously
* Early indicators without clear harm
* Disagreement about severity

**Expected outcome:** escalation occurs without waiting for harm.

---

### Vendor Dependency Stress

Scenarios that test:

* Vendor outage or delayed response
* Conflicting vendor guidance
* Loss of vendor-managed components

**Expected outcome:** governance authority remains internal and decisive.

---

### Human Fatigue and Load

Scenarios that test:

* Sustained alert volume
* Cognitive overload
* Shift handover failures

**Expected outcome:** controls remain usable or automation constrains itself.

---

### HICC (Interpretive Capacity) Stress

Scenarios that test whether the system can be governed within HICC:

* Can the designated human authority interpret boundary-relevant state in time to intervene?
* What is the decision frequency and escalation latency under load?
* Does oversight degrade into sampling, guessing, or post-hoc explanation?

**Expected outcome:** if HICC is plausibly exceeded, autonomy must constrain itself (pause / scope reduction / rollback) regardless of outcome quality.

See: `1.5.5 Human Capacity Constraints (HICC)`.

## 4.1.5 Execution Requirements

Scenario tests must:

* Involve real role holders defined in Phase 2
* Exercise actual control and escalation interfaces
* Be documented with outcomes and decision timelines

Tabletop exercises alone are insufficient.

---

## 4.1.6 Failure Classification

A scenario is considered failed if:

* Authority cannot be exercised in time
* Controls are unusable when needed
* Escalation is delayed or suppressed
* System continues operating through an unacceptable state

Failure triggers remediation before deployment or continued operation.

---

## 4.1.7 Public-Sector Context (Australia)

In Australian public-sector deployments:

* Scenarios must reflect statutory obligations
* Testing must include public accountability stress
* Outcomes must be auditable

Stress testing supports lawful decision-making, not just resilience claims.

---

## 4.1.8 Relationship to Other Phases

Scenario stress testing:

* Validates freezes from Phases 1–3
* Precedes deployment and live operation
* Informs failure mode testing (4.2)

If systems cannot pass scenario stress testing, they are not eligible for deployment.

---

## 4.1.9 Governance Implication

Stress testing is not a technical exercise.

It is a **governance rehearsal under pressure**.

Systems that only work in calm conditions are not governable in the real world.
