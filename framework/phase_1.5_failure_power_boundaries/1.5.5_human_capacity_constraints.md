# 1.5.5 Human Capacity Constraints (HCC)

Governance fails when authority exists on paper but cannot be exercised in time.

This section defines **Human Capacity Constraints**: structural limits on human oversight that, when exceeded, render “human control” symbolic rather than operational.

This is not a critique of humans.
It is a constraint on system legitimacy.

---

## 1.5.5.1 Purpose

Human capacity constraints exist to:

- Prevent “final human authority” from functioning as governance theatre
- Define the boundary where delegated authority outgrows human governability
- Make *capacity* an explicit requirement of legitimate authority
- Force system designers to constrain autonomy/complexity to what humans can realistically govern

---

## 1.5.5.2 Core idea

A system may have:

- assigned authority
- documented policies
- intervention rights
- escalation pathways

…and still be **illegitimately governed** if humans cannot practically interpret when intervention is required.

Authority without capacity is symbolic.

## 1.5.5.3 Published constraint (v1): HICC

### Human Interpretive Capacity Constraint (HICC)

**Definition**

A system must not operate at a level of autonomy, complexity, or decision frequency that exceeds the sustained interpretive capacity of the human(s) empowered to govern it.

If the governing human cannot reliably:

- understand what the system is doing,
- recognise when it is crossing boundaries,
- and intervene in time,

then “human final authority” is not operational.

It is performative.

## 1.5.5.4 HICC as a legitimacy boundary

A system is considered to have crossed the HICC boundary when any of the following are true in steady operation:

- Boundary‑relevant decisions occur faster than humans can interpret and respond
- Oversight requires continuous context assembly beyond realistic human attention
- The system’s state cannot be summarised to a governing human without loss of critical meaning
- Intervention triggers are so ambiguous that humans must guess under time pressure

Crossing this boundary is not a “risk.”
It is a governance failure condition.

## 1.5.5.5 Unacceptable state

**Unacceptable State (HICC):**

> A consequential system is operating beyond the interpretive capacity of its designated human authority, such that timely and informed intervention cannot be reliably exercised.

This state is unacceptable even if:

- no incident has occurred,
- metrics look good,
- compliance artefacts exist,
- or the system is “working as intended.”

---

## 1.5.5.6 Observable signals (examples of evidence, not a checklist)

Signals that strongly suggest HICC breach:

- escalating alert volume with no reduction in uncertainty
- rising escalation latency (time between signal and action)
- repeated reliance on “we didn’t realise” after boundary crossings
- growing exception lists and manual patches to maintain control
- decision volume that forces supervision into sampling rather than comprehension

---

## 1.5.5.7 Governance posture

When HICC breach is plausible:

- the burden of proof sits upstream (operators are not required to prove harm)
- operation must be constrained (pause / scope reduction / rollback)
- autonomy must be reduced until interpretability and response time are restored

HICC is enforced as a constitutional boundary, not a post‑incident lesson.

---

## 1.5.5.8 Relationship to later phases

- **Phase 2.3 (Human Control Guarantees):** meaningful human control must include capacity, not only authority.
- **Phase 3 (Architecture):** interfaces, control surfaces, and autonomy limits must be designed to keep the system within HICC.
- **Phase 4 (Testing):** stress tests must explicitly attempt to push the system beyond HICC.
- **Phase 5 (Operation):** monitoring must track signals that indicate interpretive overload and erosion of control.

## 1.5.5.9 Note on future constraints

This repository will treat human capacity as a *family of constraints*.

Only **HICC** is published here today.
Additional constraints may be developed and published after validation to avoid premature expansion or reader overload.
