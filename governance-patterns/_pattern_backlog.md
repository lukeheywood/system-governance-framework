## Backlog entries

### Candidate Pattern: <working title>

- **Triggering observation (high-level):**  
  A brief, non-specific description of what drew attention.  
  (No organisations, systems, timelines, or sequences.)

- **Governance tension observed:**  
  What felt unstable, unowned, implicit, or unenforceable at a governance level.

- **Primary invariant implicated:**  
  - 0.1 — Object of governance  
  - 0.2 — Legitimate authority  
  - 0.3 — Boundary & enforcement  

- **Secondary invariants (if any):**  
  Optional.

- **Repetition:**  
  - First observation  
  - Observed multiple times  
  - Widely recognised pattern  

- **Confidence level:**  
  Low / Medium / High  
  (Low = intuition only; High = repeated, cross-contextual)

- **Abstraction test:**  
  Can this be described without:
  - naming an organisation?
  - referencing a specific system?
  - implying a replayable sequence?

- **Status:**  
  Draft / Observed / Eligible for promotion / Archived

- **Notes:**  
  Any uncertainty, alternative readings, or reasons for hesitation.
