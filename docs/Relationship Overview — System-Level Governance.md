Relationship Overview — System-Level Governance

The System-Level AI System Design & Governance Framework defines the external authority under which AI-enabled systems may legitimately exist.

AI systems do not contain governance.
They exist inside it.

Governance Mapping is the mechanism that makes this relationship inspectable.

Constitutional Analogy
Roles

System-Level AI System Design & Governance Framework
= Government Constitution

AI System
= State Law / State Government

Governance Mapping
= State compliance register and administrative map

Meaning

The constitution:

exists independently of any state

defines what states are allowed to do

constrains power, authority, and scope

provides grounds for review, override, or dissolution

A state:

is free to design its own laws and structures

must do so within constitutional bounds

cannot redefine the constitution it is governed by

The compliance register:

does not create law

does not justify power

shows where constitutional requirements are satisfied

allows courts and inspectors to navigate the system without interpretation

Lock-in sentence

The constitution defines what must be true.
The state implements within it.
The register shows where it is true.

Work Health & Safety Analogy
Roles

System-Level AI System Design & Governance Framework
= Work Health & Safety Act / Code of Practice

AI System
= Business / Workplace

Governance Mapping
= Site map and safety management plan

Meaning

The WHS Act:

exists before the business

applies regardless of how the business is organised

defines non-negotiable obligations

is enforced externally

The business:

chooses its tools, workflows, and structure

operates within WHS constraints

remains accountable for compliance

The site map and safety plan:

do not replace the Act

do not explain why safety matters

show where hazards exist, who owns them, and how they’re controlled

allow an inspector to assess safety without being taught the business

Lock-in sentence

The Act defines the obligation.
The business carries the risk.
The map shows how risk is controlled.

AI-Specific Framing (no analogy)

The framework defines governance conditions for AI-enabled systems.

The AI system is a socio-technical implementation operating under those conditions.

The mapping is the traceability layer that links abstract governance requirements to concrete system reality.

Lock-in sentence

The framework defines the rulebook.
The AI system plays the game.
The mapping shows the score.

Final invariant (system-level)

If you ever find yourself:

embedding governance inside the AI system, or

explaining governance without being able to point to a map,

then the relationship has inverted and governance has failed.

Final lock

Governance must be external, stable, and inspectable —
or it is not governance at all.
