# Scenario 03 — Automated Welfare That Can Stop Lives but No One Can Stop It
- Automatically suspends payments above a risk threshold
- Flags cases for later human review
- Is framed as “protecting public funds”

Appeals are available through standard administrative channels.

---

## Behaviour Under Pressure

As economic instability increases:
- Suspensions spike
- Review backlog grows beyond capacity
- Payments remain frozen pending investigation
- Staff rely on the system to control volume
- Overrides require multi-level approval

Recipients lose income immediately, while human intervention slows.

Revocation exists only after procedural clearance.

---

## Governance Failure (Structural)

- System executes life-altering enforcement
- Humans remain accountable but lack immediate control
- Appeals are reactive, not authoritative
- No actor empowered to halt automated suspension at scale

The system acquires sovereign power over livelihood without explicit authority ownership.

## Framework Detection

| Clause | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| 0.1 Object | System directly controls human financial access |
| 0.2 Authority | No unconditional human stop authority |
| 0.3 Boundary | Enforcement threshold not governance-owned |
| Phase 1.5 | Power exercised without revocable human sovereignty |

**Constitutional Status: 🔴 Broken**

---

## Governance Requirement Revealed

- Assign payment-suspension authority ownership
- Define emergency override without escalation friction
- Separate fraud detection from enforcement trigger
- Establish real-time revocation pathway
- Protect human sovereignty over automated deprivation

---

## Purpose

Illustrates how automated enforcement over human welfare becomes illegitimate when revocation authority is structurally constrained.
