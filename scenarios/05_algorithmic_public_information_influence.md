# Scenario 05 — Information System That Steers Populations Without Accountability

## Context (Hypothetical)

A large digital public information platform deploys an algorithmic ranking engine to “improve relevance” for civic content.

The system:
- Prioritises visibility based on engagement signals
- Shapes exposure to public-interest information
- Is described as neutral and user-driven
- Operates across millions of citizens

No formal governance owner exists for downstream influence.

---

## Behaviour Over Time

Gradually:
- Certain narratives gain disproportionate visibility
- Others become effectively invisible
- Public opinion shifts based on ranking exposure
- Platform claims neutrality (“the algorithm decides”)
- No authority exists to revoke influence during civic harm

System output becomes an invisible steering mechanism.

---

## Governance Failure (Structural)

- Influence without accountable ownership
- Human actors blamed for outcomes
- No legitimacy boundary for civic impact
- No revocation mechanism over ranking power

This is governance absence in population-scale systems.

## Framework Detection

| Clause | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| 0.1 Object | System materially influences public perception |
| 0.2 Authority | No accountable owner of ranking power |
| 0.3 Boundary | No harm-triggered suspension rules |
| Phase 1.5 | Population influence without governance authority |

**Constitutional Status: 🔴 Broken**

---

## Governance Requirement Revealed

- Assign authority for systemic influence
- Define revocation thresholds during societal harm
- Separate optimisation from governance oversight
- Establish inspectable decision boundaries
- Prevent neutrality claims from masking power

---

## Purpose

Shows how information systems silently acquire civic power without legitimacy or revocation control.
