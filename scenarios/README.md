# Scenarios — System-Level Governance Stress Tests

This folder contains hypothetical stress simulations designed to illustrate structural governance failure modes across complex socio-technical systems.

These are not case studies.
They are fictional, systems-engineering style scenarios used to test the framework under extreme pressure conditions.

---

## Purpose of These Scenarios

* Demonstrate how systems become illegitimate without explicit authority and revocation structures
* Show failure that occurs even when organisations believe they are compliant
* Illustrate governance gaps without referencing real institutions or data
* Provide a safe, universal testing surface for the framework

---

## Design Constraints

Each scenario is intentionally:

* Generic and non-identifiable
* Free from real organisations, jurisdictions, or datasets
* Focused on structure, power, authority, and control
* Written as governance simulations, not narratives

They function similarly to:

* Safety engineering stress models
* Constitutional thought experiments
* Systems failure simulations used in high-risk domains

The goal is not drama.
The goal is legibility.

## What These Scenarios Reveal

These scenarios help readers see how:

* Advisory systems become de facto authority
* Automation replaces decision-makers without revocation
* Responsibility detaches from control
* Legitimacy drifts silently under pressure

They are included to strengthen the framework’s universality and to demonstrate that governance failures are structural, repeatable, and detectable before harm occurs.

## Important Notice

No scenario refers to a real system.
No scenario should be interpreted as commentary on any specific organisation.

They are governance simulations only.
