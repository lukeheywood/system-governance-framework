# Scenarios — System-Level Governance Stress Tests

This folder contains hypothetical stress simulations designed to illustrate structural governance failure modes across complex socio-technical systems.

These are not case studies.
They are fictional, systems-engineering style scenarios used to test the framework under extreme pressure conditions.

Purpose of these scenarios:

Demonstrate how systems become illegitimate without explicit authority and revocation structures

Show failure that occurs even when organisations believe they are compliant

Illustrate governance gaps without referencing real institutions or data

Provide a safe, universal testing surface for the framework

Each scenario is intentionally:

Generic and non-identifiable

Free from real organisations, jurisdictions, or datasets

Focused on structure, power, authority, and control

Written as governance simulations, not narratives

They function similarly to:

Safety engineering stress models

Constitutional thought experiments

Systems failure simulations used in high-risk domains

The goal is not drama.
The goal is legibility.

These scenarios help readers see how:

advisory systems become de facto authority

automation replaces decision-makers without revocation

responsibility detaches from control

legitimacy drifts silently under pressure

They are included to strengthen the framework’s universality and to demonstrate that governance failures are structural, repeatable, and detectable before harm occurs.

No scenario refers to a real system.
No scenario should be interpreted as commentary on any specific organisation.

They are governance simulations only.
