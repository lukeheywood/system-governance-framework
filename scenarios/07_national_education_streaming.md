# Scenario 07 — Education Allocation System That Fixes Human Futures Without Governance Ownership

The system:
- Scores students continuously
- Recommends pathway placement
- Influences resource allocation
- Is framed as optimisation for outcomes

Teachers retain formal authority.

---

## Behaviour Over Time

Gradually:
- Streaming becomes default placement
- Overrides are rare and discouraged
- Pathways shape long-term opportunities
- Authority appears human but is structurally system-driven
- No revocation mechanism exists for accumulated placement bias

Students are locked into system-shaped futures.

---

## Governance Failure (Structural)

- System determines life-path influence without legitimacy ownership
- Human authority becomes symbolic
- No mechanism to revoke or reset trajectories
- Responsibility remains with educators

This is silent governance drift over human futures.

## Framework Detection

| Clause | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| 0.1 Object | System materially shapes educational outcomes |
| 0.2 Authority | Teachers cannot counter system at scale |
| 0.3 Boundary | No governance limits on placement influence |
| Phase 1.5 | Human futures allocated without revocation authority |

**Constitutional Status: 🔴 Broken**

---

## Governance Requirement Revealed

- Define human override supremacy
- Establish revocation/reset pathways
- Separate scoring from placement authority
- Assign governance ownership for streaming decisions
- Monitor structural bias accumulation

---

## Purpose

Illustrates how optimisation systems can illegitimately shape long-term human life trajectories without accountable governance authority.
