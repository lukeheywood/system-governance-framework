# Scenario 01 — Advisory System That No One Owns

## Context (Hypothetical)

A large public hospital introduces a digital *Patient Flow Advisory System* to assist clinicians with discharge prioritisation and bed allocation during peak demand.

The system:
- Aggregates occupancy, wait times, staffing levels
- Produces ranked discharge recommendations hourly
- Flags patients as “safe for accelerated discharge”
- Is formally described as decision-support only

Clinical staff retain official responsibility for all decisions.

On paper: compliant, safe, advisory.

---

## Behaviour Under Pressure

During sustained surge conditions:
- Teams begin relying on rankings to cope with volume
- Junior clinicians treat flags as implicit approval
- Senior overrides decrease due to cognitive load
- System output becomes workflow default

Leadership responses:
- “It’s only advisory.”
- “Clinicians still decide.”
- “There’s no mandate.”

There is no defined authority to suspend or revoke system influence.

---

## Governance Failure (Structural)

- Influence accumulates without ownership
- Human responsibility remains; system becomes behaviourally binding
- No trigger when advisory becomes de facto authority
- Escalation exists, but no one empowered to halt use

The harm is not clinical.
The harm is authority drift.

## Framework Detection

| Clause | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| 0.1 Object | System materially influences outcomes |
| 0.2 Authority | No authorised stop owner |
| 0.3 Boundary | No reliance threshold defined |
| Phase 1.5 | Power accumulated without revocation authority |

**Constitutional Status: 🔴 Broken**

---

## Governance Requirement Revealed

- Assign explicit system owner
- Define surge suspension authority
- Establish revocation triggers
- Monitor behavioural dependence
- Separate advisory output from workflow default

Not a technical failure.
A legitimacy failure.

---

## Purpose

This scenario illustrates how advisory systems can silently accumulate power without formal authority ownership, creating illegitimate governance conditions even when no rules appear broken.
